### Overview
This is a pet project from Scrimba React Course. It's a practice of useState() and useEffect(), making API calls with Axios, mapping through arrays, creating onClick events, conditionally rendering components, and adding CSS classes. The project is a quiz that makes a call to Trivia API and displays 5 random questions and 4 answer options, afterward, the answers are checked and incorrect are displayed in red and corrects in green. A player can see a score of correct answers and start a new game.
